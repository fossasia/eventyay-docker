Setup of EventYay via docker compose
====================================

add the following entries to your /etc/hosts file, or
change all the hostnames in various config files in docker-compose.yaml
and config/**
	127.0.0.1       app.eventyay.com
	127.0.0.1       video.eventyay.com

create an .env file, example is .env.example which currently contains
	POSTGRES_USER=CHANGEME_eyadmin
	POSTGRES_PASSWORD=CHANGEME_eypass
	VOLUMES_DIR=./data
	CONFIG_DIR=./config

create the VOLUMES_DIR

create
	data/talk/data
	data/ticket/data
	data/video/data
	data/video-webapp/public
and make them 0777 (ugo+rwx !!!)


run
	docker compose up -d

wait and watch
	docker compose logs -f


when the building of all files settled:

log into eventyay-ticket and make initial setup
	docker exec -ti eventyay-ticket bash

	> cd
	> pretix createsuperuser

this creates also the talk superuser!!!

DO NOT ACCESS THE WEB PAGES BY NOW !!!!

log into eventyay-talk and make initial setup
 	docker exec -ti eventyay-talk bash

	> cd
	> pretalx init

and use the same email and password as in pretix!!!!


After that:
* log into tickets
* create SSO OAUTH key under Admin -> SSO Key for the correct domain
* save client id and secret to pretix.cfg

Start from scratch
* the redis volumes need to be removed
	maybe only necessary when changing server name
* always do first the superuser setup as laid out above



no idea what needs to be done for eventyay-video
